        <h1>Freelance Mentor Program</h1>
        <p>The Freelance Mentor Program looks to provide mentor resources to a broad range of teams.
			It can be difficult for students to commit to mentoring a team for a full season and there are always teams looking for more mentors.
			To solve these issues, the Freelance Mentor Program allows University of Michigan students with expertise in areas such as chassis, electronics,
			and programming to assist teams on a case by case basis. For example, if a team needs programming help, a few members of this program could visit a team and provide assistance with their programming.
			This would allow the team to get help, while not committing these kids to mentoring for the full season.</p>
			
		<p class="bold">This program is currently a work in progress. We hope to have this implemented for the 2018 FRC season.</p>
