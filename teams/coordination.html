        <p>We at FAMNM do our best to provide assistance to teams that need mentors and/or resources.
			We make sure all of our mentors are trained and teach them to act professionally and try to provide as many resources as we can.
			We currently assist and work with the FRC and FLL competition levels. If your team would like to be affiliated with FAMNM and receive some of these benefits,
			please contact one of our Coordinators.</p>
