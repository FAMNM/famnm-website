        <h2>Waterjet</h2>
        <p>One of the Resources we are available to provide to teams is waterjet time. We are provided with about 5 hours of Waterjet Time each year.
			For cutting parts out of aluminum or steel sheets, the waterjet can create parts to very tight tolerances.
			The picture to the right is the waterjet cutting out a chassis plate for Team 830: The Rat Pack.</p>
		<p>This waterjet time is donated to us by the FABLab (The Digital Fabrication Lab at Taubman College).</p>
        <h2>3D Printing</h2>
        <p>The University of Michigan gives students free 3D printing. If you’re needing something 3D printed we can try to assist.
			Free printing is reserved to items smaller than 6”x6”x4”, although if there are larger parts we can try to accommodate.</p>
			
		<p class="bold" style="margin-top: 1em; text-align: center;">We are constantly looking to add more resources and help local teams however we can</p>
