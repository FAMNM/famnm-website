            <p class="text-par">
                FAMNM is an on campus effort to unite all of the
                various departmental and individual student efforts of
                supporting the <i>FIRST<sup>&reg;</sup></i> program locally and throughout the
                state of Michigan. We act as a liaison between local FIRST
                teams, the University of Michigan, and any other organizations
                that are affiliated with either of the prior organizations
                stated (such as MEZ, WISE, Maker Works and the Fab Lab). FAMNM
                aims to support the FIRST teams with funds, volunteers,
                University resources, and publicity, with the ultimate goal of
                strengthening the relationship between the University and
                FIRST programs.
