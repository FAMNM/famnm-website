            <h1>Supporting FAMNM as a Student Organization</h1>
            <h2>Partner for Volunteer Hours</h2>
            <p class="text-par">FAMNM hosts and participates in a variety of on and off
                campus events throughout the school year. If your members are having
                difficulty completing volunteer hour requirements, or are looking for
                STEM-focused volunteer opportunities, reach out to
                <a href="mailto:famnm.vp@umich.edu">famnm.vp@umich.edu</a>.
                FAMNM supports both long-term volunteering partnerships and one-time
                events. The table below contains an approximate timeline for some of
                our major events, though by no means is it complete. Please note
                that all volunteers at FAMNM events are required to have completed
                a university background check and the minors on campus training.

            <p class="text-par">
                FAMNM's on and off campus events are great places to
                interact with future wolverines, their families, and the Ann Arbor
                Robotics community. All of our north campus events are great places
                to demo your team's project to enthusiastic students or set up a table
                to engage your target communities. Most of these events fall between
                August and January, contact <a href="mailto:famnm.vp@umich.edu">famnm.vp@umich.edu</a>
                for the current dates.

            <h2>Connect with the College of Engineering Community</h2>
            <p class="text-par">FAMNM enthusiastically participates in a number of College
                of Engineering community-building events. Join us for the CoE Diversity
