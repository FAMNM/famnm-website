        The Robot Quick Build (RQB) is an event held in early January, usually
        the day after our FRC Kickoff event. Teams work with FAMNM members to
        jumpstart their FRC season by getting a working drivetrain on the first
        day of build season! FAMNM offers assistance in mechanical, electrical,
        programming, and game strategy. Check out some highlights from last
        year's RQB in the image slideshow above!
