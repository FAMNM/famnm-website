                FAMNM is open to all University of Michigan students. Our members
                come from many different backgrounds, colleges, and majors, and some
                have never even participated in {{ FIRST }} before! We know
                that as a UofM student, your schedule is tight. FAMNM lets you put as
                much or as little in as you want and works completely around your
                schedule. Signing up is easy! Just join us on <a
                href="https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/FAMNM">Maize Pages</a>
                and we'll get in touch.
            </p>

            <p class="text-par">If you have any questions, feel free to send
                them to <a

                                Michigan and beyond! We'll do our best to 
                                make sure you can get to all the events of
                                your choosing. Volunteers serving in key 
                                roles are eligible to be reimbursed for
