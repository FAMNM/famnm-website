                    Any team that would like to obtain support and resources 
                    from FAMNM must become affiliated with FAMNM by working 
                    with one of our Coordinators to review and customize a contract.
                    This will outline the expectations and responsibilities of 
                    both parties so as to ensure that FAMNM is best meeting the
                    team’s needs and structure.
