            <h2>Partner for Volunteer Hours</h2>
            <p class="lead">FAMNM hosts and participates in a variety of on and off 
                campus events throughout the school year. If your members are having 
                difficulty completing volunteer hour requirements, or are looking for 
                STEM-focused volunteer opportunities, reach out to 
                <a href="mailto:famnm.vp@umich.edu">famnm.vp@umich.edu</a>.
                FAMNM supports both long-term volunteering partnerships and one-time 
                events. The table below contains an approximate timeline for some of 
                our major events, though by no means is it complete. Please note 
                that all volunteers at FAMNM events are required to have completed 
                a university background check and the minors on campus training.

            <h2>Middle and High School Outreach Opportunities FIRST Robotics Students</h2>
            <p class="lead">FAMNM’s on and off campus events are great places to 
                interact with future wolverines, their families, and the Ann Arbor 
                Robotics community. All of our north campus events are great places 
                to demo your team’s project to enthusiastic students or set up a table 
                to engage your target communities. Most of these events fall between 
                August and January, contact <a href="mailto:famnm.vp@umich.edu">
                famnm.vp@umich.edu</a> for the current dates.
            </p>

            <h2>Connect with the College of Engineering Community</h2>
            <p class="lead">FAMNM enthusiastically participates in a number of College 
                of Engineering community-building events. Join us for the CoE Diversity 
                Mixer, listen to other organization’s stories with us at DEI-focused
