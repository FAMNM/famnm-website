                                  <p>Robot in 3 Days is a challenge in which collegiate teams rush to build a robot capable of playing the current FRC game in only three days.
                                     Teams begin their build at the end of the game reveal during the kickoff broadcast and must complete their robot in no more than 72 hours.</p>
                                  <p>FAMNM estabilshed its Ri3D team in 2019, and built a robot to compete in the first-ever FIRST Alumni Collegiate Competition, an Ri3D competition hosted
                                     at Kettering's FIRST Robotics Community Center. Competing alongside other Ri3D teams from Michigan State University, Ferris State University,
                                     Grand Valley State University, and Kettering University, the FAMNM Ri3D team managed to wrest their way to victory and claim the <span class="font-weight-bold">first-ever FACC Ri3D trophy!</span></p>

                                 <p>Our primary goal is to show new FRC teams the process behind designing and building a robot from the ground up to compete in an FRC competition.
                                    To this end, we aim to extensively document our design and build processes through extensive videotaping and publishing our source code and CAD
                                    files online for teams to view.</p>
                                 <p>FAMNM Ri3D also provides an avenue for University of Michigan students to combine what they learned through FIRST and throughout their college career
                                    and apply it to building an FRC robot.</p>
