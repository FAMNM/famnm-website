        id: "ostem"
        description: "Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (oSTEM) is a national organization with several chapters across the country. The UM chapter started as the Student Alliance of Gay Engineers (SAGE), which was founded in December 2007, with its first meeting held in January 2008. In May 2010, SAGE offically changed its name to oSTEM in order to better represent the majors and identities that the organization strives to support. We hold social events every other week or so: dinners, cider and doughnuts, board game days, and other activities allow members to get together and bond outside weekly meetings. We also host larger scale events such as company dinners and professor panels as a way for our members to learn about others' experiences with being out in the workplace and to build connections with LGBTQ professionals in their fields."
