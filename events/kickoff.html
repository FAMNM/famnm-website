                    </div>
                    <div id="solarcar" class="card-body collapse">
                        <p>The University of Michigan Solar Car Team is an entirely student-run organization that designs and builds solar electric vehicles. The team races both nationally and internationally. Since its establishment in 1990, the
                            team has built 13 vehicles, won the American Solar Challenge nine times, won the Abu Dhabi Solar Challenge, placed third in the World Solar Challenge five times, and most recently came in second in the 2017 World Solar
                            Challenge. The team is recognized as the most successful team in North America.</p>
                        <p>It takes the team 2 years to build a new car. Improvements on the design and construction of the next car begin immediately following the completion of the current one. In the summer, the team is either participating in
                            the American Solar Challenge or preparing for the World Solar Challenge, depending on the year. This makes it essential to maintain a level of commitment within the organization year-round.</p>
                        <p>Our team is an entirely student run project team that designs, builds, and races the world's fastest solar vehicles. With four engineering divisions; mechanical, electrical, aerodynamics, and strategy, as well as operations
                            and business divisions, our team brings together students from a multitude of backgrounds and disciplines to work together towards a common goal: win our races.</p>
                        <p>The Race Crew, composed of around 20 people, for the World Solar Challenge takes off the fall semester in order to travel to Australia to race. The crew ships off to Australia in early September. They then go through a
                            solid month of strenuous testing. The team stays at a hostel during this month and works around-the-clock on the car in a nearby workspace. The strategists adjust to predicting car performance and energy usage in the
                            Australian sun, the engineers practice driving the car on new roads, and eventually the crew runs a "mock race" 1,800 miles from one side of the country to the other in order to prepare for the real 1,800 mile race.
                            While the Race Crew is in Australia, the interim leaders take charge in Ann Arbor to keep the team running efficiently.</p>
                        <p>This summer the team will seek our 10th national championship in the 2018 American Solar Challenge, a 1,700 mile race that runs from Omaha, Nebraska to Bend, Oregon!</p>

                        <p>M-HEAL (Michigan Health Engineered for All Lives) is a student organization that empowers students to design human-centered solutions for global health inequities. We provide students with opportunities to build the necessary
                            skills for global health design through interactive workshops; local, domestic, and international volunteering opportunities; and project experience.</p>
                        <p>We support a diverse set of project teams at a variety of stages in the design process from problem definition to prototyping. Project teams communicate regularly with in-country partners to develop community-specific solutions,
                            and travel to deliver prototypes and gain feedback for future iterations. Our Incubator program offers members ways to explore new ideas and learn new skills; interested members either develop their own need statement
                            or are provided with one, and then, small teams are guided through the design process. In all of our activities, M-HEAL strives to cultivate a well-informed, creative, and collaborative community prepared to make a
                            positive impact for global health.</p>

                        <p>NSBE's mission is "to increase the number of culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community." We represent one of the largest student-run organizations
                            in the country, with over 30,000 active members. Our membership spans not only states, but countries.</p>
                        <p>The University of Michigan's NSBE chapter was chartered in 1984 and has become very active in the College of Engineering. NSBE sponsors community outreach projects, social gatherings for members, and brings company representatives
                            to general body meetings for networking opportunities.</p>

                        <p>The Society of Women Engineers at the University of Michigan provides its members with the ideal engineering and college experience. Every year, we run the biggest career fair on campus, invite over 350 companies to host
                            corporate information sessions, engage hundreds of K-12 students across the globe in engineering outreach activities, host several charity events (including a 5k Fun Run and The Engineering Games), and organize several
                            networking and professional development events. Our mission statement is to encourage women to excel as engineers and leaders, and to promote an inclusive community within the College and the profession that fosters
                            universal success in engineering, independent of gender.</p>
