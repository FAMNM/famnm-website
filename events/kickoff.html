                        <p>The University of Michigan Solar Car Team is an entirely student-run organization that
                            designs and builds solar electric vehicles. The team races both nationally and
                            internationally. Since its establishment in 1990, the
                            team has built 13 vehicles, won the American Solar Challenge nine times, won the Abu Dhabi
                            Solar Challenge, placed third in the World Solar Challenge five times, and most recently
                            came in second in the 2017 World Solar
                            Challenge. The team is recognized as the most successful team in North America.</p>
                        <p>It takes the team 2 years to build a new car. Improvements on the design and construction of
                            the next car begin immediately following the completion of the current one. In the summer,
                            the team is either participating in
                            the American Solar Challenge or preparing for the World Solar Challenge, depending on the
                            year. This makes it essential to maintain a level of commitment within the organization
                            year-round.</p>
                        <p>Our team is an entirely student run project team that designs, builds, and races the world's
                            fastest solar vehicles. With four engineering divisions; mechanical, electrical,
                            aerodynamics, and strategy, as well as operations
                            and business divisions, our team brings together students from a multitude of backgrounds
                            and disciplines to work together towards a common goal: win our races.</p>
                        <p>The Race Crew, composed of around 20 people, for the World Solar Challenge takes off the fall
                            semester in order to travel to Australia to race. The crew ships off to Australia in early
                            September. They then go through a
                            solid month of strenuous testing. The team stays at a hostel during this month and works
                            around-the-clock on the car in a nearby workspace. The strategists adjust to predicting car
                            performance and energy usage in the
                            Australian sun, the engineers practice driving the car on new roads, and eventually the crew
                            runs a "mock race" 1,800 miles from one side of the country to the other in order to prepare
                            for the real 1,800 mile race.
                            While the Race Crew is in Australia, the interim leaders take charge in Ann Arbor to keep
                            the team running efficiently.</p>

                            Our team consists of everyone from freshman to graduate students, representing majors from
                            the College of Engineering and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
                            We strive to inspire and educate students about space, Mars exploration, and engineering,
                            and we focus on helping students grow as engineers.</p>
                        <p>As a competition-oriented team, our goal is to win the annual University Rover Challenge
                            (URC) at the Mars Society's Mars Desert Research Station near Hanksville, Utah.
                            The competition has gained worldwide attention from academia and industry, and teams from
                            all over the globe come to compete.
                            This year, the URC will be hosting 36 teams from ten countries, and MRover is one of eleven
                            teams representing the United States.</p>

                        <p>Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (oSTEM) is a national organization
                            with several chapters across the country. The UM chapter started as the Student Alliance of
                            Gay Engineers (SAGE),
                            which was founded in December 2007, with its first meeting held in January 2008. In May
                            2010, SAGE offically changed its name to oSTEM in order to better represent the majors and
                            identities that the organization strives to support.</p>
                        <p>We hold social events every other week or so: dinners, cider and doughnuts, board game days,
                            and other activities allow members to get together and bond outside weekly meetings.</p>
                        <p>We also host larger scale events such as company dinners and professor panels as a way for
                            our members to learn about others' experiences with being out in the workplace and to build
                            connections with LGBTQ professionals in their fields.</p>
