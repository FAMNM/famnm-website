                FAMNM is planning to try and make FRC Kickoff 2021 a helpful
                virtual experience for teams. As a result, we think it is 
                unlikely that there will be a RQB this upcoming academic 
                year. If you're a rookie team and would like support from 
                FAMNM during your 2021 build season, please reach out to 
                <a href="famnm.frc">FAMNM's FRC Coordinator</a> who can help
                connect you to available mentorship and other resources.
            </p>

                The Robot Quick Build (RQB) is an event held in
                early January, usually the day after our FRC Kickoff event.
                Teams work with FAMNM members to jumpstart their FRC season
                by getting a working drivetrain on the first day of build season! FAMNM
                offers assistance in mechanical, electrical, programming, and game strategy.
                Check out some highlights from last year's RQB below!
