            <h3>FAQ</h3>
            <dl class="text-left">
              <dt>Are there awards?</dt>
              <dd>Yes, there will be awards given at the end of elimination matches.</dd>
              <dt>Are there practice matches?</dt>
              <dd>Practice matches are tentatively scheduled for Friday evening (August 2) during team load-in (see schedule below).</dd>
              <dt>Do we have to show up on Friday?</dt>
              <dd>No, although we recommend it. If you know that you won't be arriving until Saturday, let us know so we can plan ahead.</dd>
              <dt>Can we compete with more than one robot?</dt>
              <dd>Yes - as long as all of your robots can play this year's game. Let us know in the sign-up form if you would like to do this. A few important notes, however:
                <ul>
                  <li>We can't guarantee spots for multiple robots. If the event reaches capacity, spots for additional robots will be granted in registration order.</li>
                  <li>Your robots might have to play in the same match, so bring enough students to drive them!</li>
                  <li>Additional robots will be assigned numbers in the reserved 9985-9999 range, which will require reprogramming your radio and roboRIO. We will let you know of your team number assignment before the event, but we can help with reprogramming your components at the event too.</li>
                </ul>
